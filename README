This is a snake game written in Python 3. The command "python3 game.py" should run it.
Dependencies: pygame
To get pygame to work with python 3, you need to download this experimental version:
https://launchpad.net/debian/experimental/+source/pygame/1.9.2~pre~r3144-1/+files/pygame_1.9.2~pre~r3144.orig.tar.gz
dependencies for pygame:
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion  libportmidi-dev

then go to the folder that you extracted for pygame and run:
sudo python3 setup.py install

and it'll work. That wasn't too hard, was it? :)
